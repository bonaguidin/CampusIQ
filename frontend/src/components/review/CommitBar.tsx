 * than recomputing from sections/drafts. Two independent counts of the same
 * thing drift the moment one call site changes, and the failure mode here is a
 * bar that promises "3 fields will stay empty" above a ledger reading 4 --
 * which would make the student distrust both numbers.
 *
 * Also renders ConfirmingOverlay while `confirming` is true. That lives here,
 * not in the two review screens, because this is the only component both flows
 * share -- putting it here is what makes it impossible to fix the in-flight
 * feedback for one flow and forget the other.
