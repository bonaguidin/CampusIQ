 * What to tell the student for each way an upload can fail.

 * The backend went to deliberate trouble to keep these distinguishable -- two
 * different 413s, and an "encrypted" extraction status that exists as its own
 * status precisely so callers can branch on it. Collapsing them back into one
 * "we could not process that file" throws that away, and it throws away the
 * only part the student can act on: these three failures have three different
 * fixes, and one of them takes ten seconds.
 *
 * The backend's own message is shown underneath as the detail line; this is
 * the actionable headline it cannot supply.
