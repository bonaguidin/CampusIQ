"""Reconstruct a student profile dict from Postgres, shaped like the JSON one.

Placed alongside supabase_client.py rather than under features/ because it is a
data-access concern, not a feature concern: every caller already holds a
session-scoped client from build_client_for_token, and the feature runners stay
completely unaware of where their profile dict came from.

The output is structurally interchangeable with what
GradusIQ_career.api.load_student_profile returns from data/students/*.json, so
the runners in features/ need no change to consume it.

UNCONFIRMED ROWS
----------------
Rows whose confirmed_at is null are parser output pending student review. They
are excluded from the profile rather than silently dropped: every exclusion is
recorded as (row, reason) in the returned result, mirroring how
academics/gpa.py already treats "unconfirmed" as a first-class, reportable
reason rather than an invisible filter. Callers may ignore the list today, but
the record exists from the start so a review UI can explain omissions later.
